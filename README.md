# SQLite chinook database

Chinook SQLite database script plugin for Magic that simply installs the Chinook database into
your _"/etc/sqlite/templates/"_ folder for you, such that you can rapidly create the database,
and play around with the Crudifier.

Licensed under the terms of the MIT. Notice, the SQL script itself is the copyright of Luis Rocha.

## Data Model

The Chinook data model represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media
tracks, invoices and customers.

## Sample Data

Media related data was created using real data from an iTunes Library. Customer and employee
information was manually created using fictitious names, addresses that can be located on Google maps,
and other well formatted data (phone, fax, email, etc.). Sales information is auto generated using
random data for a four year period.
